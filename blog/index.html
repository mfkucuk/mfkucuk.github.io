		<h1>Feyyaz's Random Blog</h1>
		<p id="fixedMessage">Hello everyone, welcome to my blog! I have zero experience in blogging and I thought I might give it a try.
		I will be mostly writing about my days and my thoughts. I am not sure if it'll be a daily thing, but I will try 
		my best to write as often as I can.</p>

			<p>So yeah, I guess I'm writing on a weekly basis now. Because most of the times, I forget it. Now that the semester started, I'm even more forgetful.
			Anyways, I've been trying to adapt to my classes. I'm really glad I have no biology anymore but since some of my instructors changed, I'm kind of bummed.
			For example, I can't understand what my Math132 teacher is saying nor I can read his hand writing. I was also demoralized because of my CS instructor
			changing. But to be honest, I like the new instructor as well. I am having a hard time studying and finishing assignments at the moment, and I'm still
			trying to adapt to that and concentrate. And, hopefully I will eventually.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I spend most of my time playing Divinity 2 and Persona 4 Golden (So close to finishing Persona) or I watch TV shows and YouTube videos. I currently
			started re-watching B99 and alongside it I'm watching Legend of Korra. I love B99 and Andy Samberg and I'm really glad I started watching it again.
			About LoK, I thing it's great. Of course, it's not good as The Last Airbender, but I'm having fun with it so far. My only complaint is that the villain
			keeps changing every book. So, the story is not really stable. At least, that's what I think.</p>
			<br>
			<p>And oh, about the CS102 project, I found great people to work with. We are allowed to propose a project or choose from the existing ones. It seems
			like we are not going to propose although there were some good ideas. I proposed a game engine idea which has a easy-to-understand scripting language
			and it has its own pixel art and music editor. And, you can implement them easily into your game. I may try to attempt this on my own alongside the
			group project. From the existing ones we chose organizer for travelers, a smart calendar, or a social platform for sharing items. We're going to be asked
			to make one these.</p>
			<p>Lastly, I dual-booted my computer last week. It seemed like most of the developers are using Linux. So, decided use it as well. And, I chose to
			dual-boot with Ubuntu. I'm really liking it so far. Probably because this is the first time I'm using an OS other than Windows. And I'm trying to get
			everything done with the command line, so I can be more familiar with the Terminals. That's about it. See you at the next entry.</p>

			<p>Hello, it's been a while. I said I would write an entry last wednesday but I was way to tired and lazy. Besides I didn't have interesting things to
			talk about. Today, my lessons were supposed to start, but due to a issue about CS102 today's lessons were cancelled. Yay, one more day to relax? 
			It really doesn't matter at this point. I really feel demoralized now that my CS102 instructor is going to change. One good thing though. My schedule has
			only 4 days of class. So I'm pretty free, every monday this semester. And, I am going to write more entries now with the semester is starting.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I kinda have an idea for a big project but I never really started on it. Might as well save that idea for CS102 term project. In my first CS101 class
			our instructor showed us a term project from the past. It was about folding paper and cutting shapes on it and I thought that was really creative.
			And with my project this semester, I wanna acheive the same thing. About Java, I did take a peak to how GUIs work in Java, and I also did some exercises
			on Java to not get rusty.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I also did some Web Developing which I think is very fun. I added that random generation thing I was talking about for my DnD Sheet Generator project.
			Now, you can create a sheet with randomizing nearly every aspect. I went outside of plain JavaScript and learned some Angular JS. I realized these kinds of
			frameworks can really make your job easier. Using Angular JS, I made a DPS calculator for a game I play. It basically has a lot of characters, so I made a
			template of how the DPS calculator is going to look for all of them. It took about an hour or two whereas if I used plain JavaScript it would take way much
			more time. So, I kinda experienced the importance of frameworks. Other than that, I made small projects related to physics. One of them lets you experiment
			elastic collision. A cool fun-fact about that: Every time one object's mass gets multiplied by 100 the number of collision between to objects will give you
			the digits of pi. I found that pretty interesting and still don't know why it happens. Other one lets you experiment falling of a ball where you can play with
			the x-speed and gravity.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Oh one last thing, I am no longer using the domain provided by my university. I opened a GitHub repo for website and now I'm sharing my projects and this
			blog on that repo. And if you're reading this entry you probably realized this is now a GitHub repo. Anyways that's it for now. I still have a lot of things
			to talk about but I want to keep it short. See you all for now. :)</p>

			<p>Hello everybody. Today's friday, so the first half of the holiday is almost over. There are still 12 days until Spring Semester begins, but I feel
			like time is passing by too fast. After my last entry, I did the things I said; I learned more about JArduino and tried to come up with an idea for my
			big project. And, I did actually come up with an idea. Though, it's still in the design phase. After that, the last two days went empty. I said that
			I don't want to waste any time in this holiday, and it actually started great. In the beginning, I felt like I was productive, but right now I just want
			to be lazy. So yeah, I've been sleeping too much and playing games - mostly Persona 4 Golden - for the last 2 - 3 days.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Despite being lazy, I was able to add some new things to Rain Simulator. I added thunder sound and a better UI. Also I moved a copy of my website to
			GitHub. I've been using GitHub for a while but I used Git for the first time when moving my website. This is actually about it despite not writing for 2 days.
			The reason for that is as I said, I'm starting to get a bit lazy. So I'll probably write the next entry on next Wednesday and hopefully by then I will have
			more things to talk about. Well, see you for now. </p>

			<p>Hello everyone. I wasn't able to write anything yesterday, so I thought I could write about both yesterday and today. Still have no ideas
			about a big project but I am working on updates for my smaller projects. I added sound to my rain project. And, volume of the audio affects 
			the speed and quantity of the rain drops. Definitely thinking of some other sounds and a better look for the rain and the website itself. To be honest, all
			of my other websites need a better look. Though, I am currently happy with them. For example, I like how my blog has a simple look and how it kind
			of resembles a diary. An update for the DnD Sheet Generator is also on the way. I'm thinking of an option where you only fill out your own name
			and everything else is random. The class, race, background; Even the bonuses coming from them will be random. Meaning that, you will not be able to choose
			skills to add proficiency to. The reason I want to do something like this is, I want my program to have an option to literally generate a sheet because
			that's what it says in it's name right?</p>
			<br>
			<p>I've been also still watcing EEE term projects since yesterday, and today I decided to take my Arduino out to do stuff with it. It's been
			a long time, so I had the re-learn the syntax and such. I even forgot how a breadboard works, but I learned it again after some searching.
			Well, I didn't do anything crazy because it's been too long. But I made a fun system with LEDs and buttons. I also wanted to use Arduino 
			in my Java projects and found out about a Java class called JArduino. I wasn't able to sort it out today but definitely more digging on that
			tonight.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Other than nerd stuff, I've been sitting in front of my computer a lot, so I decided to do some sports. I feel too lazy to go out and run,
			I just do some warm-up exercises and start working on my chest and abdominals. It's been too long since I've done anything related to sports
			thanks to Corona, I feel very rusty and I get tired quickly. So, I'm keeping my sets short. Same thing goes for my eating. I really can't say I'm
			a keen-set person. And, it's been going even worse and I realize it's not healthy. So, since I started sports, I'm also trying to eat more food.
			Being a CS major means sitting in front of the computer even more. So, I should make doing sports a habit.</p>
			<br>
			<p>So that's pretty much it for this entry. I'll probably focus on JArduino tonight. And, probably I will get a pen and paper and try sketching
			stuff which might give me an idea for my big project. Well, see you next time! :)</p>

			<p>Hello again, it's me. Today was a really empty day for me. I kept thinking about what to do for my big project during this holiday, but
			unfortunately I couldn't come up with anything. So, I watched some videos on YouTube. I checked out the Bilkent EEE102 term projects, and
			watched some other videos. I gotta say, the projects I saw were pretty cool. I also think EEE is a cool department overall. After watching 
			a lot of videos, I played some Persona 4 Golden. It's one my favourite games of all times. I beat it 3 times on my PSVita. And now, I bought it
			from Steam and I'm trying to beat it on Very Hard mode. It's taking some time because of grinding but I honestly enjoy the challenge.
			After that, I returned to thinking about my 'big' project. But, it was no good so instead, I attemped to make a little project and I succeeded.
			I made a rain simulator using HTML and JavaScript and I'm really happy about it. Here's a photo of it.</p>

			<img height="50%" width="50%" src="Photos/rainSimulator.png">

			<p>You can't tell much from a photo but it rougly looks like this. I definitely want to make some updates on this like sounds (rain drops, 
			thunder, and etc.) and a ground so the water can actually splash. So yeah, this basically all the things I did today. In the upcoming days 
			I really want to come up with an bigger idea and also I want to update the Rain Simulator and DnD Sheet Generator. That's it from me for today. 
			Well, see you later!</p>

		<div class="entry">
			<p>This is my first entry. I'm actually really excited about it. I know many people will not even see this but it feels good to
			write stuff. It feels soothing. Anyways, today was the last day of my finals. Last exam was biology and I'm really glad that's over.
			This will probably be the first and the last biology class I've taken in Bilkent. Other than that, I'm completely free for the next two
			weeks. I really don't want to waste any time in this holiday. I'm thinking of starting a bigger project than DnD Sheet Generator. It might
			be a web project or a Java one but I definitely want to work on something so that I don't get rusty. I might even consider getting ahead
			of CS102 curriculum and learn some Java GUI. Also I want to learn about game engines such as Unity or Godot. Since we're expected to make
			a Java project by the end of CS102 I was trying to come up some ideas and I thought of making my own game engine. A lot of people out there
			are saying that the best game engine to use is your own. After some digging I found out that most of the big game companies actually do write
			their own game engines for their big projects. So, I definitely should check out Unity or Godot sometime.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I also played some Divinity: Original Sin 2 with my friends. I've been really enjoying playing that game. It really feels like you're playing
			a DnD game. Here, this is my character:</p>

			<img height="25%" width="25%" src="Photos/divinityCharacter.png">

			<p>My character started of as a cleric but now it's some kind of a summoner. The helm is a give away, right? This reminds me, there are some games
			I want to finish during this holiday. I should probably make a list of the games I want to finish the most. Well anyways, this is pretty much it for today. 
			Thank you for sticking around. Hopefully, next time I will have more interesting things to talk about. :)</p>
